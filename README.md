# Analog Circuit and Theory

This repository contains the following MATLAB live script files, Each script gives an indepth description of an analog circuit design theory:

### 1. Broadband_matching_lumped_filter_network:
Simple two element or quarter wave impedance matching are simple to use and can deliver perfect power transfer at a single frequnecy. However, its bandwodth is limited. This limit its ability to transmit signals with broader bandwidth such as a pulse. This algorithm present a systematic method to obtain a impedance matching system that allows any desirable gain and bandwith tradeoff constrained by Fano-Bode criterion. The shape of the pass band is carefully defined using triditonal filter design method such as butterworth and Chebyshev approcimation.
